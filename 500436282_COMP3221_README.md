# COMP3221 Assignment 2 - Federated Learning System

This development project is a simple Federated Learning (FL) system including five clients in total and one server for aggregation 

Each client has its own private dataset, and they use this data to train their own local model. Once the local models are trained, they are communicated to the server through a secure socket connection. The server aggregates these local models to create a global model, which is then sent back to the clients to update their local models.

The FL system is simulated on a single machine by using python's '&' flag to run both the server and the clients in the background.

## Required Python Modules
- json
- matplotlib
- numpy
- os
- pathlib
- random
- socket
- sys
- threading
- time

## Usage
The system can be easily run using the shell script "run.sh"

Give any of following commands and the system will automatically initalise and run
- ./run.sh 0 0
- ./run.sh 1 0
- ./run.sh 0 1
- ./run.sh 1 1

The first command line argument determines the subclient mode for the server. '0' means the server will aggregate over 5 subclients and '1' means it will aggregate over only 2 of the 5 subclients.

The second command line argument determines the optmethod for ALL the clients. '0' means the clients will use GD optimisation for the training process and '1' means they will use mini-batch GD optimisation instead.

The system can just as easily be stopped by running the "stop.sh" script as shown below. This will kill every server and client process running in the background.
- ./stop.sh

Note that you might have to give permissions to the shell scripts before running them
- chmod a+x run.sh
- chmod a+x stop.sh

#
If you are experiencing issues with the "run.sh" shell script, you can manually start the server and clients with the following commands.

- python3 500436282_COMP3221_FLServer.py 6000  subclient &
- python3 500436282_COMP3221_FLClient.py clientid port optmethod &

where
 - subclient is either 0 or 1
 - clientid is either client1, client2, ..., client5
 - port is either 6001, 6002, ... , 6005 and is respective to clientid
 - optmethod is either 0 or 1
